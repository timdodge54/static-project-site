            <h2>Overview of Rover</h2>
            <h3>System Overview</h3>
            <p>The Adventure rover is a multidisciplinary robotics project that requires expertise in various engineering fields. The team's goal this year was to improve specific subsystems to make the rover competitive in the URC competition. The rover operates through a base station connected to the rover's computer. The rover can be controlled using gamepad controllers that regulate the speed of the wheels and movement of the robotic arm. The overall system is robust and an improvement upon last year's design. The figure below is the high-level diagram of the final design.</p>

            <h2>Arm Design</h2>
            <h3>Linear Actuator</h3>
            <p>The arm contains an aptly named component, the prismatic joint, shown in the image below. A prismatic joint is a mechanism, linkage, or other controlling device that restricts motion to one axis. The rover prismatic joint is bolted to the chassis, and subsequently, the arm is bolted to the prismatic joint. The main linkage of the arm (excluding the claw mechanism) operates in a single plane. That plane is created by the vertical axis and the axis that runs front to back of the rover.</p>

            <h3>Arm Assembly</h3>
            <p>The articulating arm is the section of the arm that ranges from being mounted on the prismatic joint and extends to the claw. At the base, the arm utilizes a Robolink D50 motor (RL-D50) mounted to the prismatic joint (Shoulder joint). The RL-D50, indicated by balloon 5 on the arm figure, is a motor-gearbox combination that supplies the torque and the precision required to control articulating arm and strong enough to hold loads up to 100kg. The next joint up the chain is the Robolink D30 (Elbow joint), which is like the RL-D50 but smaller with a lower torque rating. The final joint before the claw is the Robolink D20 (Wrist joint). The RL-D20 is light enough to lift with the arm extended, but has the required torque to move the claw. All three joints use the same DC motor with different gear boxes. Each joint is mounted together with custom-made 3D printed ABS brackets. The ABS brackets are pinned and glued to 38 mm carbon fiber tubing, which supplies the stiffness and strength required for all of the lifting and moving without the added weight of other materials such as aluminum. With the arm fully extended, it has a reach of 4.5 ft, but the maximum carry weight quickly decreases with arm extension due to the moment incurred.</p>

            <h3>Claw</h3>
            <p>Similar to the foundation of the whole arm, the prismatic joint, the prismatic claw allows one of the two grippers to have a single degree of freedom and the other gripper to remain fixed. As shown in the claws figure, the "double finger" gripper is mounted to a ball nut and driven by a lead screw allowing it a linear motion toward and away from the fixed "single finger" gripper. The grippers are 3D printed using PLA, although ABS would be a viable option as well. The driven gripper runs along a single guide rail and is printed with a low contact pattern to decrease friction as it slides across the rail. The frame of the claw uses the same 1/4" aluminum plate that the chassis is made from, cut and bent to shape.</p>

            <h2>Control System Overview</h2>
            <img src="figures/Blank_diagram.png" alt="Code Diagram of Electronics and Data Flow" class="img-fluid">
            <h3>Figure 1: Code Diagram of Electronics and Data Flow</h3>
            
            <h3>Communication and Controls</h3>
            <p>The communication scheme and connections for the Adventure rover are presented in Figure 1, which illustrates the data flow for the entire rover. As shown in the figure, the base station is connected to the rover's computer through a wireless communication system that utilizes the 900 MHz and 2.1 GHz bands.</p>
            
            <h3>Drive Controls</h3>
            <p>The previous year's team used a HERO Development board, a CAN bus-enabled microcontroller, to operate the Talon SRX speed controllers and control the speed of the motors. However, the current team reduced the number of wheels from six to four, which led to a polarity reversal of two wheels and a 33% increase in voltage to the motors, causing an increase in wheel speed. The team addressed this issue by reworking the communication and code that sends signals to the Talon SRX speed controllers. Additionally, the team reworked the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL), a C++ library, to read logitech controller inputs to regulate the motors. This allowed for static assigning of controllers to prevent conflicting signals and ensured that all controllers could be connected in any order.</p>
            
            <h3>Arm Controls</h3>
            <p>Since the arm was replaced with an in-house built arm, the motors and electronics required a complete overhaul. The new arm employs worm gear joints connected to 24V DC motors. Initially, these motors contained encoders that allowed for closed loop feedback control to track the motor's position. However, the encoders prevented full rotation of the arm, making it unsuitable for the arm's application. Therefore, an open-loop control design was implemented. The team utilized the joy framework within the Robotic Operating System (ROS) to obtain input from a logitech controller. The team created a ROS node on the base station that interprets the controller input and sends information in the form of 2, 0, and -2 to each motor, indicating the polarity and power of the motor. This information is picked up by an Arduino connected to the rover's computer, which sends a full power signal to the motor on input and decays it over half a second unless another signal is received.</p>
