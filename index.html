            <h2>Mars Rover Senior Design Project</h2>
            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> C++, C#, SolidWorks, Microcontrollers</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and implemented inverse kinematic controls for a robotic arm, allowing for efficient
                    real-time operation.</li>
                <li>Enhanced micro-controller software, reducing latency by 30% through integrating serial communication
                    with ROS.</li>
                <li>Worked with team to design a novel 6-axis robotic arm using worm-gears and linear rail actuation in
                    SolidWorks.</li>

            <h2>Epsilon Point Controller</h2>
            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Nonlinear Controls, Python, Numpy, ROS2, Gazebo</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Engineered a controller for a smooth differential drive robot to track nonlinear and time-varying
                    trajectories.</li>
                <li>Optimized controller for Turtlebot3 platform, respecting velocity constraints by applying LQR
                    techniques.</li>
                <li>Streamlined control system, achieving convergence to the true trajectory within 2 seconds of
                    receiving a new signal.</li>
